    "  Functions are advantageous to have in your programs for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "~ Modularity: Functions allow you to break down your program into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n",
    "    This makes your code easier to read, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "~ Reuse: Functions can be reused throughout your program or even in other programs.\n",
    "    This saves time and effort by eliminating the need to rewrite the same code multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "~ Abstraction: Functions allow you to abstract away complex operations into simpler,\n",
    "    more easily understood pieces. This makes your code more readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "~ Testing: Functions make it easier to test your code by allowing you to test individual\n",
    "    pieces of functionality in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "~ Scoping: Functions allow you to control the scope of variables and other resources within \n",
    "    your program. This helps prevent naming conflicts and other issues that can arise when\n",
    "    working with large programs."
